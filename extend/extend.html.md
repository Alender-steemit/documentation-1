Here are all the different ways that DocPad can be extended.

## Module
DocPad can also be used as a module in other systems
- [Browse DocPad's API](/docs/api)

## Configuration Files
Configuration files allow you to apply site specific extensions and configurations
- [How to use the configuration file](/docs/config)
- [Learn the available events](/docs/events)

## Plugins
Plugins provide extra functionality to DocPad, and can be re-used across Skeletons
- [Find existing plugins](/docs/plugins)
- [Learn to write plugins](/docs/plugin-write)
- [Learn the available events](/docs/events)

## Skeletons
Skeletons are essentially re-usable websites/projects/webapps that you've created with DocPad
- [Find existing skeletons](/docs/skeletons)
- To get your Skeleton during the bootstrap process of DocPad, post an issue on the [docpad-extras](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras) [issue tracker](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras/issues)
